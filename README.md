# Busy Shipper Capstone Project
 Problem: A shipper working in a delivery app needs to deliver n packages in a city. Because the workload is too large, he usually has to work overtime. So he decides to write a program to find the shortest route(in meters) to work more effectively. However, there are two important rules that the shipper must obey when working. Firstly, he needs to buy goods before conveying them to customers. Secondly, in the city, he can only handle a given maximum number of packages, if he overcomes this limit, he will receive a punishment (in this case, we assume that he will always follow the rules of the road, even if it can take more time).
